# Better CC
Better with Complex Contraptions!

This is Minecraft mod which will add various complex contraptions to the game.
Initialy this was meant to be a better version of ComputerCraft. But things have changed.


## What exists in 1.19 and above
* Some basic Network Cables and Serial Modems. These can be used with ComputerCraft!
* More to come!


## What happens with all the versions?

Different features of this mod exist only in different Minecraft versions **before 1.19**.

This ocured because I had different ideas for the mod.

Once the 1.19 version is complete, the features will exist on all future version.

| Version | Contents                                  |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1.16    | Some basic blocks                         |
| 1.18    | Just a copy of the oc2 mod                |
| 1.19    | More advanced blocks but not complete yet |
