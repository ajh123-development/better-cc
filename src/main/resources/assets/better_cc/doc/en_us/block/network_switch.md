![One to five, smartly](block:better_cc:network_hub)

The network switch connects multiple [network connectors](network_connector.md) with each other. It forwards any packet arriving at any attached connector to all other attached connectors, over time, this will learn where the computers are, this can lead to a more efficient network. This forwarding operation will consume one hop, reducing the packet's time to live.
